## Scientific Notation
- Allows us to compactly write very large or very small numbers

## Orders of magnitude
- Powers of ten
- Place value representation
- Operating on numbers with scientific notation

## Representing large numbers
- On paper
- On a calculator
- On a computer

## A very large number
- Avogadro's Number
- $$6.02 \times 10^{23}$$
- $$10^{1}$$ = 10
- $$10^{2} = 10 \times 10$$
- $$10^{3} = 10 \times 10 \times 10$$

## A very small number
- Gravitational Constant
- $$6.67 \times 10^{-11} (m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2})$$
- $$10^{-1} = \frac{1}{10}$$
- $$10^{-2} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10}$$
- $$10^{-3} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10 \times 10}$$
