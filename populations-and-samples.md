# Populations and Samples

## Population

A complete group of measurements or individuals of interest.

## Descriptive Statistics

Techniques used to characterize the measurements of a collection.

Mean, median, and standard deviation fall in this category.

## Sample

A subset of a population used for a measurement or treatment.

## Sampling

Measuring a few individuals from a population to get a sense of the whole.

Often it is prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to measure all of the members of a population.
Sampling is a group of techniques that allow us to measure a smaller sample that reflects the overall population.

## Inference

The use of a sample to determine the characteristics of the larger population.
