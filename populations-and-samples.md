# Populations and Samples

# Concepts

## Population

A complete group of measurements or individuals of interest.

## Sample

A subset of a population used for a measurement or treatment.

## Sampling

Measuring a few individuals from a population to get a sense of the whole.

Often it is prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to measure all of the members of a population.
Sampling is a group of techniques that allow us to measure a smaller sample that reflects the overall population.

## Inference

The use of a sample to determine the characteristics of the larger population.

## Hypothesis Testing

The practice of determining whether an observed difference is due to random fluctuations or the experiment (drug, education, etc).

## Statistical Significance

A measure of the probability that the mean of a random sample from a subpopulation was randomly drawn from the larger population.

For example, if you drew 10 random SSU students and they were all taller than 6 feet, this probably wasn't random but was at basketball team practice.

## Effect Size

This is the difference in the mean between an original distribution and the distribution after a treatment or from looking at a subpopulation.

## Central Limit Theorem

The more observations you have in your sample, the higher the probability that the mean of your observation will be close to the population mean.


## Descriptive Statistics

Techniques used to characterize the measurements of a collection.

Mean, median, and standard deviation fall in this category.
