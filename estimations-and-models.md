# Estimations and Models

We often must make important decisions without complete information.
In this class, we make mathematical estimations of quantities in order to support a decision.

This section of the text introduces the idea of defining a decision, the estimation needed to support the decision, and a mathematical model to make the estimation.
After we have made the estimation, we can evaluate its impact on our decision.

An important part of the estimation process is letting go of the idea that your answer will be "correct".
Your answer will be an estimation that will give us insight into a decision we are making.
You can ask yourself as you begin the estimation how accurate do you need to be?
This is a very different practice than many math problems which have exact answers.
