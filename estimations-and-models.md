# Estimations

We often must make important decisions without complete information.
In this class, we make mathematical estimations of quantities in order to support a decision.

This section of the text introduces the idea of defining a decision, the estimation needed to support the decision, and a mathematical model to make the estimation.
After we have made the estimation, we can evaluate its impact on our decision.



The ability to quickly estimate a quantity is an art and an excellent
way to sharpen your quantitative intuition.

You must let go of the idea that your answer will be correct.  Your
answer will be an estimation that will give us insight into a decision
we are making.  You can ask yourself as you begin the estimation how
accurate do you need to be?

You also usually can not estimate your quantity directly, but must
instead break down your estimate into other smaller estimation problems
that can be tackled individually.  We will start with simple estimations
and then move on to estimations that require more planning.

Estimates have two frequent purposes.  One is to provide evidence for a
claim.  Another is to gain insight into an unfamiliar situation.
