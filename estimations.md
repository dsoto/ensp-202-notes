# Estimations

The ability to quickly estimate a quantity is an art and an excellent
way to sharpen your mathematical intuition.

You must let go of the idea that your answer will be correct.  Your
answer will be an estimation that will give us insight into a decision
we are making.  You can ask yourself as you begin the estimation how
accurate do you need to be?

You also usually can not estimate your quantity directly, but must
instead break down your estimate into other smaller estimation problems
that can be tackled individually.


## Estimations and models
- Understand the problem
- Take a guess
- Identify the most important quantities
- Estimate the value of these quantities
- Set up the computation as clearly as possible
- Execute the computation
- Decide if the result is plausible
- See if it matches your original guess

<!-- remember, you are supporting a decision -->


## Learning Objectives
- Recognize that many of our estimations use a model as an assumption
- This assumption is often hidden

## Review
- Estimations

## Calculations and Approximations
- What is 1 + 1?
- What is 10 + 1?
- What is one thousand + 1?
- What is one million + 1?

## Approximations
- For many problems, only the first digit and the number of zeros is
important

## Easier Multiplication
- Imagine we want to multiply several large numbers but only want a
rough approximation.
- How can we do that?

## Significant Figures
- Each significant figure that we add to the multiplication affects the
    accuracy less than the previous


## Models
- We have been using models
- We have modeled each person as eating exactly the same number of
slices
- Most models assume that a real world problem will behave like a
mathematical function

## Models
- So far we have been using proportional models
- We will add exponential models
- We will add sinusoidal models


## Exercises

- What is the area of lot A?
- What is the area of SSU?
- What is the mass of the air in the ETC?

## Estimations
- Most math problems you have seen have been carefully created for you
  to solve them exactly
- Most problems that need to be solved are not so tidy
- Physicist Enrico Fermi was famous for posing these types of questions
- Precise vs Approximate reasoning

<!-- outlandish estimations -->
<!-- how many piano tuners in chicago -->
<!-- strength of atomic bomb blast -->
<!-- how much mass in kg will sonoma county poop today? -->
<!-- how many golf balls will ring the world? -->
<!-- how many hours to drive to New York?  Las Vegas? -->


## Pizza estimation
- Estimate how many pizzas it would take to feed this class?
- How did you arrive at your answer?
- Does it matter how accurate our estimate is?

## Creating your estimation
- Understand the problem
- Identify the most important quantities
- Estimate the value of these quantities
- Set up the computation as clearly as possible
- Execute the computation
- Decide if the result is plausible

## Important quantities
- How many people in the room
- How much pizza does the average person eat?

## Set up computation
$$ \textrm{people} \cdot
   \textrm{pizzas per person} =
   \textrm{number of pizzas} $$
<!-- make a few comments about units -->
<!-- these numbers represent quantities -->


## Metta World Pizza
- Estimate how many pizzas it would take for a world-wide pizza party
- What were your assumptions?

## Related estimations
- How much dough do we need?
- How many acres of wheat is that?
- How much cheese?
- How many cows is that?

## World scale estimations
- The calculation to determine the dietary needs of all humans on the
  planet isn't that far from this method of estimation.

<!-- question for groups -->
<!-- can you come up with an interesting or important estimation?  -->
