# Estimations

The ability to quickly estimate a quantity is an art and an excellent
way to sharpen your quantitative intuition.

You must let go of the idea that your answer will be correct.  Your
answer will be an estimation that will give us insight into a decision
we are making.  You can ask yourself as you begin the estimation how
accurate do you need to be?

You also usually can not estimate your quantity directly, but must
instead break down your estimate into other smaller estimation problems
that can be tackled individually.  We will start with simple estimations
and then move on to estimations that require more planning.

Estimates have two frequent purposes.  One is to provide evidence for a
claim.  Another is to gain insight into an unfamiliar situation.


## Models

We will learn how to create simple models that enable us to gain insight
into the problem we are investigating.

- A simplified representation of a problem we'd like to solve
- A model is an approximation that allows us to think about the world
- Models:
    - rectangle
    - linear increase or decrease
    - exponential increase or decrease
    - a roll of a die or several dice
    - a bathtub with a faucet and a drain
- The situation you are modeling won't always look exactly like the
    model
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- Can you think of an example of a model?
- Models often contain assumptions about the problem that others may not
    share

## Estimations and models
- Understand the problem
- Take a guess
- Identify the most important quantities
- Estimate the value of these quantities
- Set up the computation as clearly as possible
- Execute the computation
- Decide if the result is plausible
- See if it matches your original guess


## Models
- We have been using models
- We have modeled each person as eating exactly the same number of
slices
- Most models assume that a real world problem will behave like a
mathematical function
- Models are normative and make assumptions about the world
- Modeling is the important mathematical literacy we are developing

# Pizza Example

This is a simple example to illustrate estimation and modeling.

- We are going to spend money on pizza
- If we spend too much, we waste pizza
- If we spend too little, folks go hungry
- As you can see, the stakes are high

## Pizza estimation
- Estimate how many pizzas it would take to feed this class?
- How did you arrive at your answer?
- Does it matter how accurate our estimate is?
- How accurate does our estimate need to be?

## Important quantities
- How many people in the room
- How much pizza does the average person eat?
- Note that our numbers describe something physical

## Set up computation
$$ \textrm{people} \cdot
   \textrm{pizzas per person} =
   \textrm{number of pizzas} $$
<!-- make a few comments about units -->
<!-- these numbers represent quantities -->


## Metta World Pizza
- Estimate how many pizzas it would take for a world-wide pizza party
- What were your assumptions?

## Related estimations
- How much dough do we need?
- How many acres of wheat is that?
- How much cheese?
- How many cows is that?

## World scale estimations
- The calculation to determine the dietary needs of all humans on the
  planet isn't that far from this method of estimation.
- How much land would this take?

## Future topics

- Quantities, dimensions, and units
- Scientific notation for representing large numbers
- Using computers to ensure reliable computation

# More complex models

In the Art of Insight, Sanjoy Mahajan presents ways of determining what
estimations you need to make in your model.  A useful tool is a tree
model.

This diagram is a tree model to help us determine the volume of a dollar
bill.

Note how we break up our goal estimation into smaller problems and then
work to determine if the smaller problems require further decomposition.


# Arguments

You are frequently presented with arguments persuading you to think,
act, spend, or vote in a certain way.  How will you evaluate the
validity of these arguments, especially when mathematics is involved?

- Many arguments rely on mathematical claims
- Are the arguments sound?
- Are the math claims made to support the argument valid?
- What assumptions to these claims make?  Would you agree?
- What alternate explanations are possible?

## Arguments

- What makes a strong argument?
- What are logical fallacies?

# Activities

## Body Calibrations

For many simple units, it is useful to know lengths as they relate to
you body.

- Inches and centimeters can be found on your hands
- How far up your body is a meter?
- What is a cubit?
- How long is your stride when walking?
- How fast do you walk?

## Fermi Problems
- What is your estimate of the world population?
- How many students at Sonoma State?
- How many nail salons are there in Rohnert Park?
