# Estimations

The ability to quickly estimate a quantity is an art and an excellent
way to sharpen your mathematical intuition.

- Quiz today

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize that many of our estimations use a model as an assumption
- This assumption is often hidden

## Review
- Estimations

## Calculations and Approximations
- What is 1 + 1?
- What is 10 + 1?
- What is one thousand + 1?
- What is one million + 1?

## Approximations
- For many problems, only the first digit and the number of zeros is
important

## Easier Multiplication
- Imagine we want to multiply several large numbers but only want a
rough approximation.
- How can we do that?

## Significant Figures
- Each significant figure that we add to the multiplication affects the
    accuracy less than the previous

## Quiz

## Models
- We have been using models
- We have modeled each person as eating exactly the same number of
slices
- Most models assume that a real world problem will behave like a
mathematical function

## Models
- So far we have been using proportional models
- We will add exponential models
- We will add sinusoidal models
