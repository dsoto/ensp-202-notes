## Performing computations

While we want to develop our intuition when we are estimating with large
numbers, performing accurate calculations is also important.  You will
be able to calculate these numbers on a hand-held calculator, in Excel,
and using scientific computing platforms like Python or Julia.

- sign up at sage math cloud
    - here is a nested list
- create notebook
- choose julia kernel
- find my publicly shared file and fill in
- print PDF and turn in during class
- markdown vs code cells
- naming variables
- shift enter to execute
- show them LaTeX


- create account
- create project
- create file jupyter notebook
- change kernel in kernel menu to Python 3 or Julia (not python 2)
- SHIFT-ENTER to evaluate your code

and using scientific computing platforms like Python or Julia.

Since our calculations are often used as evidence to support an
argument, they must be easy to read and have clear methods and
assumptions.  Using a computer to preserve the details of the
calculation is often preferable to using a calculator.

## Basic computations

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^ or **)

To perform basic calculations with numbers, we can type numbers into the
computer and use the symbols above to perform the calculation.

In the Jupyter notebook, press shift-enter to evaluate a cell.
