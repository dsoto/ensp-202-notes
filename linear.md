- How much CO2 is emitted by automobiles in the United States?

# Models

- Taxi cab ride
- Pizza price with toppings
- Electricity bill

# Intercepts

## Due Today
- Nothing

## Learning Objectives
- Able to extrapolate from proportions
- Conceptual understanding of linear regression
- Conceptual understanding of y-intercept
- Recognize physical systems with linear models

<!-- we will be linking this more practical approach with the formal -->
<!-- mathematics -->

## Second Third of course
- Linear function
- Areas and Volumes
- Exponential Functions
- Trigonometric Functions

## Linear equation
$$ y = mx + b $$

## Estimations
- The estimations we have used so far have assumed linear models
- We often have a quantity $x$ and we have to figure out $m$ to get $y$.

## Estimations

## Linear equation
![](../figures/slope-intercept.pdf)

## Proportion
- If $b=0$ we say $x$ and $y$ are proportional
- Symbol $\propto$
- If two things are proportional, the values of the two properties are
  related by a constant factor
- For the purposes of estimation, we may treat certain things as
  proportional as an approximation.

## Linear equations
- If $b \neq 0$ it is a linear function.
- For both, a change in $x$ has a change in $y$ no matter the value of x.

## Circle questions
- Is the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius?
- Is the constant of proportionality the same for all circles?
- Is the area of a circle proportional to its radius?

<!--
no, it is proportional to the radius squared
sometimes we may say it is proportional, but not by the math definition
-->

## Linear relationships
- What other quantities have linear relationships?

## When does proportion and linearity stop being useful?
- What is linear?
- What is not linear?

## Mathematical function
$$ \pi = \frac{P}{4} $$
Where $\pi$ is the number of pizzas and $P$ is the number of persons

## Computer function

    pizzas_per_person = 1/4
    pizzas(people) = pizzas_per_person * people

    pizzas(8) => 2
    pizzas(7e9) => 1,750,000,000
