# Linear Function Introduction

Many of our questions and estimations can be determined by linear
relationships.

Linear relationships are defined by a straight line when graphed.

A linear relationship means that for a given change anywhere in the independent
variable (x-axis) there is a change in the independent variable.  This
is equivalent to saying the slope is the same anywhere in the
relationship.

## Linear equation
$$ y = mx + b $$

## Linear equations
- If $$b \neq 0$$ it is a linear function.
- For both, a change in $$x$$ has a change in $$y$$ no matter the value of x.

## Estimations
- The estimations we have used so far have assumed linear models
- We often have a quantity $$x$$ and we have to figure out $$m$$ to get $$y$$.

## Learning Objectives
- Able to extrapolate from proportions
- Conceptual understanding of linear regression
- Conceptual understanding of y-intercept
- Recognize physical systems with linear models

## Linear Extrapolation

- If we assume a relationship, we can predict its value in the future

## Linear Fits

- If we have a bunch of data that is roughly linear, we can extract a
    model

# Details

## Models

Name some models or phenomenon that exhibit a linear relationship.

- Taxi cab ride
- Pizza price with toppings
- Electricity bill

## Intercepts

- What types of models are likely to have an intercept?
- What models will have an intercept of zero?

## Proportion
- If $$b=0$$ we say $$x$$ and $$y$$ are proportional
- Symbol $$\propto$$
- If two things are proportional, the values of the two properties are
  related by a constant factor
- For the purposes of estimation, we may treat certain things as
  proportional as an approximation.

## Circle questions
- Is the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius?
- Is the constant of proportionality the same for all circles?
- Is the area of a circle proportional to its radius?

<!--
no, it is proportional to the radius squared
sometimes we may say it is proportional, but not by the math definition
-->

- Brainstorm a list of questions you are interested where the answer
    will be a slope, an intercept, or a linear projection.
