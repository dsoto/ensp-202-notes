# Arguments

Our scientific progress and the strength of our democracy our based on a shared understanding of how the world is.
Many of these claims about the world are based in quantitative evidence.
We are also seeing that people are putting deliberately false but plausible news on the web because it will earn them money.
How will you use your knowledge of mathematics to sharpen your critical thinking and separate falsehoods from legitimate reporting?
Will you be able to look at quantitative data and see any problems of justice that the data show?

You are frequently presented with arguments persuading you to think,
act, spend, or vote in a certain way.  How will you evaluate the
validity of these arguments, especially when mathematics is involved?

- Many arguments rely on mathematical claims
- Are the arguments sound?
- Are the math claims made to support the argument valid?
- What assumptions to these claims make?  Would you agree?
- What alternate explanations are possible?



## Arguments

- What makes a strong argument?
- What are logical fallacies?


# Critical Thinking

There are several important concepts from critical thinking that we will
use in this class.

## The Principle of Charity

- Consider an argument to be rational and worthy of exploration
- If we see an quantitative analysis we disagree with, it is only through
    understanding it that we can seek to find its flaws

## Rival Causes

- The first explanation is not always the correct one
- Rival causes are plausible reasons for observing the same outcome
- It is often useful to examine multiple rival causes to see which one
    is the best explanation
