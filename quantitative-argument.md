# Arguments

You are frequently presented with arguments persuading you to think,
act, spend, or vote in a certain way.  How will you evaluate the
validity of these arguments, especially when mathematics is involved?

- Many arguments rely on mathematical claims
- Are the arguments sound?
- Are the math claims made to support the argument valid?
- What assumptions to these claims make?  Would you agree?
- What alternate explanations are possible?

## Arguments

- What makes a strong argument?
- What are logical fallacies?


# Critical Thinking

There are several important concepts from critical thinking that we will
use in this class.

## The Principle of Charity

- Consider an argument to be rational and worthy of exploration
- If we see an quantitative analysis we disagree with, it is only through
    understanding it that we can seek to find its flaws

## Rival Causes

- The first explanation is not always the correct one
- Rival causes are plausible reasons for observing the same outcome
- It is often useful to examine multiple rival causes to see which one
    is the best explanation
