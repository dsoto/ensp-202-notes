# Place Value

Why can we represent millions of different numbers even though we only
have 10 symbols in the arabic numeral system?  The answer is that the
position of each symbol relative to the other numbers changes its value.

## Different representations of numbers
- Roman numerals
- Babylonian base 60

## Different bases
- We can use any number as the basis of a place-value system
- Computers use base 2 and 16

## What if you only have eight fingers?

## Base 8
- $8^0 = 1$
- $8^1 = 8$
- $8^2 = 64$

## Multiplying and dividing large numbers

$$ 10^a \cdot 10^b = 10^{a+b} $$

$$ c \cdot 10^a \cdot d \cdot 10^b = c \cdot d \cdot 10^{a+b} $$
