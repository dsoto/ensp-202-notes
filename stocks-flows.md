# ENSP 202, Lecture 22, Stocks and Flows

## Stocks and flows
- Bath tub model
- Steady state
- Residence time

## Future activities
- Carbon dioxide concentration in ETC
- California drought

## Bath tub model
- Flow in
- Flow out

## Steady State
- Level in bathtub is steady

## Residence time
- How long does something remain in the bath tub

## Brainstorm
- What things could be modeled with this

<!-- parking lot -->
<!-- bank account -->
<!-- carbon dioxide -->
<!-- students in the university -->


# ENSP 202, Lecture 23, Stocks and Flows

## Announcements
- Sonoma Sustainable Enterprise Conference Thu 30 April 2015
- Future Makers Youth Summit Sat 2 May 2015
- Fall ENSP Class Link
- Geography classes


## Carbon dioxide Activity
- Estimate persons in the room with carbon dioxide?
- Draw stock and flow of room
- List relevant quantities
- Create estimates for the relevant quantities
- Synthesize estimates to create overall estimate

<!-- see photos from the whiteboards -->


# ENSP 202, Lecture 24, Stocks and Flows

## Learning Objectives
- Able to use stock and flow models to make estimates
<!-- earlier part of class was calisthenics -->
<!-- these are the skills you need -->

## Question
- Based on carbon dioxide measurements, what is our estimate of the
    number of persons in the ETC?

## Review the Method
- State question
- Plan of attack
- Break down
- Synthesize

## Review people calculation
- Carbon dioxide people calculation
- We started with a question, how many people given a carbon dioxide
    measurement
- We decided on a model to look at this
- We asked what smaller problems we could solve to take on the larger
    problem
- We tried to solve each of these smaller pieces
- We then synthesized everything

## Review notes
- Chalkboard review

## Using modern computation tools
- Show Calca with units

<!--
breath_volume = 0.5 liter exhalation/breath

breath_co2_concentration =  0.05 liter co2/liter exhalation

co2_per_breath = breath_volume * breath_co2_concentration => 0.025 liter co2/breath

co2_per_person_minute = co2_per_breath * 13 breath / min / person => 0.325 liter co2/((min)*person)

ppm_per_person_per_minute = co2_per_person_minute / 600e3 liter air => 5.417e-7 liter co2/((min)*person*liter air)

ETC_ppm_per_minute = 6.7e-6 liter co2/liter air/min

ETC_ppm_per_minute / ppm_per_person_per_minute  => 12.369 person
-->

## We were off
- What did we miss?
- Fresh air entering through windows?
- Breath estimates?
- Air mixing?


## California Drought
- What questions can we ask about the drought?
- Which of these questions can use a box model?

<!-- now, I'm not even going to give you the question -->
<!-- what would you like to know about the drought? -->
<!-- what big questions do you have -->
<!-- how might we break these into smaller questions -->
<!-- break into groups and ask large and small questions -->
<!-- what is your total water footprint? -->
<!-- what parts do you think are most important -->
<!-- what parts do you think are least important? -->
