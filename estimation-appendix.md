# Pizza Example

This is a simple example to illustrate estimation and modeling.

- We are going to spend money on pizza
- If we spend too much, we waste pizza
- If we spend too little, folks go hungry
- As you can see, the stakes are high

## Pizza estimation
- Estimate how many pizzas it would take to feed this class?
- How did you arrive at your answer?
- Does it matter how accurate our estimate is?
- How accurate does our estimate need to be?

## Important quantities
- How many people in the room
- How much pizza does the average person eat?
- Note that our numbers describe something physical

## Set up computation
$$ \textrm{people} \cdot
   \textrm{pizzas per person} =
   \textrm{number of pizzas} $$
<!-- make a few comments about units -->
<!-- these numbers represent quantities -->


## Metta World Pizza
- Estimate how many pizzas it would take for a world-wide pizza party
- What were your assumptions?

## Related estimations
- How much dough do we need?
- How many acres of wheat is that?
- How much cheese?
- How many cows is that?

## World scale estimations
- The calculation to determine the dietary needs of all humans on the
  planet isn't that far from this method of estimation.
- How much land would this take?



## Body Calibrations

For many simple units, it is useful to know lengths as they relate to
you body.

- Inches and centimeters can be found on your hands
- How far up your body is a meter?
- What is a cubit?
- How long is your stride when walking?
- How fast do you walk?

## Fermi Problems
- What is your estimate of the world population?
- How many students at Sonoma State?
- How many nail salons are there in Rohnert Park?



## Body Estimations

Determine the parts of your body that are close to common measures of
length.

- Centimeter
- Inch
- Meter

Also, your stride is a useful measurement for long distances.  Walk at a
natural pace and determine the length of your stride.

## Making estimates

Using the length standards you have created with your body, estimate the
following lengths and show your conversions.

- Length and width of your desk
- Length and width of the ETC

*Example:*

$$ 3 \textrm{cubits} \cdot \frac{1.3 \textrm{feet}}{1 \textrm{cubits}} = 3.9
\textrm{feet} $$

Use both metric and english units for each answer.
