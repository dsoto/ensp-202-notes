# Statistics

- Statistics helps us quantify uncertainty
- Helps us infer about a large population from a small sample

# Questions that use Statistics

- How many organisms use Copeland Creek as habitat?
- How dangerous is driving?
- Is gender or racial bias an observable problem?
- What is the average class size at SSU?  What is your average class
    size?  Are they different?

## Topics
- Probability
- Probability Distributions

## Decision making
- How do we make decisions when we cannot predict the outcome?
- How do you decide to bring an umbrella?

## Probability distribution
- Some events are expressed as single probabilities
- Other events are better described by a probability distribution

## Probability distribution examples
- Temperature
- Wind speed
- Climate forecasts

## Probability
$$ \textrm{probability} =
   \frac{\textrm{specific outcome}}
        {\textrm{all outcomes}} $$

- Is a measure of the likelihood that something will occur.

## Conceptual probability
- For many things, we cannot predict a single outcome, but we can
  predict the average outcome
- Coin toss
- Roll of dice

<!-- Although we can't predict a single flip or roll, we know what percentage -->
<!-- of heads or tails we will observe over many flips. -->

## Rolling two real dice

## Probability distribution
- We interpret probabilities as the area under the curve

## Probability
- How do we know if a treatment is effective?

## Example: Rash treatment

| Treatment     | Rash got better | Rash got worse |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Skin Cream    | 223             | 75             |
| No skin cream | 107             | 21             |

## Which was more effective?
- Split into groups and determine why

## Motivated numeracy
- Science Comprehension Thesis
- Identity-protective Cognition Thesis
- [Paper Link](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992)

"more Numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity
selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result
most consistent with their political outlooks."

## Experiment results
- Performance on politically neutral issue correlated with numeracy
- Highly numerate people with strong political beliefs found the answer
  consistent with their political beliefs

## Cancer screening example

|            | positive test | negative test |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| has cancer | 72            | 8             |
| no cancer  | 694           | 9226          |

## Questions

- What questions can you answer with this data?


## Cancer example as percentages

|            | positive test | negative test |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| has cancer | 90%           | 10%           |
| no cancer  |  7%           | 93%           |

- 0.8% of population has cancer
- 99.2% of population is cancer free

<!-- this needed major scaffolding -->
<!-- students had a very hard time holding the pieces together -->
<!-- students also seemed very disinterested late in the semester -->
