# Motivation

This course deals with the application of mathematics to imprecise,
real-world applications.  In order to move from prescribed textbook
problems to more open-ended ones, we need to develop some further
skills.

For example, what does it mean to think mathematically?  How is applied
mathematics -- using math to tackle problems --
different from mathematics as you understand it?

## Why are you in college?

- What is important about your degree?
- Is the diploma important?
- Is your choice of major important?
- Are the abilities you will develop important?
- One popular reason is to have better employment
- To get better employment one needs better skills
- Applied mathematics skills are valuable for many jobs and problems

## Why is math important to you?

- Do you see yourself using math in the future?
- What kinds of math do you think are most important?

## The power of mathematics

- Mathematics sharpens your common sense.
- Many critical questions about the environment, government, and social
justice are essentially mathematics questions.
- We will demonstrate the power of basic mathematical concepts to gain
insight into these sorts of problems.

## The power of mathematics

Mathematics allows you to see the similar structure in many different
situations.  It is similar to the way a knowledge of music allows you to
see the
[similarity between many popular
songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpB_40hYjXU)

## Limits of Quantitative Reasoning

- Mathematics can only describe the world as it is
- It isn't a good tool for claims about how it should be
- Positive statements are about how the world is
- Normative statements are how we think the world should be

## Learning objectives

- Increase your confidence using mathematics
- Able to use mental and mathematical models
- Quantitative critical thinking

## Knowledge and Skills

- You will gain very little knowledge in this class since we will be
    using mathematics you have already learned
- You will gain many new skills in applying your existing mathematics to
    problems

## Using Computers

We will learn to use computers to perform and communicate our
estimations and mathematical arguments.


# Activities

## Get to know your neighbor
- Form groups of two or three and discuss any of the following
- What do you like most and least about math?
- What do you hope to get from this class?
- What is your greatest fear about this class?
- Is math important to your career goals?
<!-- now introduce your neighbor to the class -->

## Questions

Think of questions that you want to know the answers to.  Then ask
yourself whether or not mathematics can help answer them.

Here are a few examples:

- Is climate change an urgent problem?
- Does our justice system treat everyone equally and fairly?

Challenge yourself by coming up with a list of twenty questions.
