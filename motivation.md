# Motivation

This course deals with the application of mathematics to imprecise,
real-world applications.  In order to move from prescribed textbook
problems to more open-ended ones, we need to develop some further
skills.

For example, what does it mean to think mathematically?  How is applied
mathematics -- using math to tackle problems --
different from mathematics as you understand it?

## Why are you in college?

- What is important about your degree?
- Is the diploma important?
- Is your choice of major important?
- Are the abilities you will develop important?

## Why are you in college?

- One popular reason is to have better employment
- To get better employment one needs better skills
- Applied mathematics skills are valuable for many jobs and problems

## Why is math important to you?

- Do you see yourself using math in the future?
- What kinds of math do you think are most important?

## The power of mathematics

- Mathematics sharpens your common sense.
- Many critical questions about the environment, government, and social
justice are essentially mathematics questions.
- We will demonstrate the power of basic mathematical concepts to gain
insight into these sorts of problems.

## The power of mathematics

Mathematics allows you to see the similar structure in many different
situations.  It is similar to the way a knowledge of music allows you to
see the
[similarity between many popular
songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpB_40hYjXU)

## Your attitude toward mathematics

Much of your success will depend on your beliefs about your ability to
learn and improve through effort.

## Do you believe you are a "math person"

- Are you comfortable with mathematics?
- Do you think your abilities can improve with effort and practice?
- When you make important financial decisions, will you try to
    understand the details?

## Grit, Mindset, Effort

- This will not always be easy or pleasurable
- You should be prepared to fail
- Some of your efforts should look like [this](https://t.co/gpISMANVMz)
- I frequently struggle to learn new branches of mathematics


# Course Content

## Learning objectives

- Increase your confidence using mathematics
- Able to use mental and mathematical models
- Quantitative critical thinking

## Models

We will learn how to create simple models that enable us to gain insight
into the problem we are investigating.

- A simplified representation of a problem we'd like to solve
- A model is an approximation that allows us to think about the world
- Models:
    - rectangle
    - linear increase or decrease
    - exponential increase or decrease
    - a roll of a die or several dice
    - a bathtub with a faucet and a drain
- The situation you are modeling won't always look exactly like the
    model
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- Can you think of an example of a model?

## Arguments

You are frequently presented with arguments persuading you to think,
act, spend, or vote in a certain way.  How will you evaluate the
validity of these arguments, especially when mathematics is involved?

- Many arguments rely on mathematical claims
- Are the arguments sound?
- Are the math claims made to support the argument valid?
- What assumptions to these claims make?  Would you agree?

## Knowledge and Skills

- You will gain very little knowledge in this class since we will be
    using mathematics you have already learned
- You will gain many new skills in applying your existing mathematics to
    problems

# Using Computers

We will learn to use computers to perform and communicate our
estimations and mathematical arguments.

## Computation vs Quantitative Reasoning

- You have been asked to perform computations
- Your are given a mathematical expression and asked to compute it
- We will practice coming up with the correct expression to compute

## Bloom's Taxonomy

There are different levels of cognitive skills that we sharpen in higher
education.  Your goal should be to exercise the highest levels of
cognitive skills.

- Remembering
- Understanding
- Applying
- Analyzing
- Evaluating
- Creating

# Activities

## Get to know your neighbor
- Form groups of two or three and discuss any of the following
- What do you like most and least about math?
- What do you hope to get from this class?
- What is your greatest fear about this class?
- Is math important to your career goals?
<!-- now introduce your neighbor to the class -->

## Questions

Think of questions that you want to know the answers to.  Then ask
yourself whether or not mathematics can help answer them.

Here are a few examples:

- Is climate change an urgent problem?
- Does our justice system treat everyone equally and fairly?

Challenge yourself by coming up with a list of twenty questions.
