# Motivation

This course deals with the application of mathematics to imprecise,
real-world applications.

What does it mean to think mathematically?

What questions are you curious about that will require quantitative
thinking to answer.

Mathematics sharpens your common sense.

Many critical questions about the environment, government, and social
justice are essentially mathematics questions.

We will demonstrate the power of basic mathematical concepts to gain
insight into these sorts of problems.

We will learn how to create simple models that enable us to gain insight
into the problem we are investigating.

Mathematics allows you to see the similar structure in many different
situations.  It is similar to the way a knowledge of music allows you to
see the
[similarity between many popular
songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpB_40hYjXU)

# Important Aspects of this course

## Learning objectives

- Increase your confidence using mathematics
- Able to use mental and mathematical models
- Quantitative critical thinking

## Models

- A simplified representation of a problem we'd like to solve
- Models:
    - rectangle
    - linear increase or decrease
    - exponential increase or decrease
    - a roll of a die or several dice
    - a bathtub with a faucet and a drain
- The situation you are modeling won't always look exactly like the
    model

## Model Thinking

- A model is an approximation that allows us to think about the world
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- Can you think of an example of a model?

## Arguments

You are frequently presented with arguments persuading you to think,
act, spend, or vote in a certain way.  How will you evaluate the
validity of these arguments, especially when mathematics is involved?

- Many arguments rely on mathematical claims
- Are the arguments sound?
- Are the math claims made to support the argument valid?
- What assumptions to these claims make?  Would you agree?

## Knowledge and Skills

- You will gain very little knowledge in this class since we will be
    using mathematics you have already learned
- You will gain many new skills in applying your existing mathematics to
    problems

# Using Computers

We will learn to use computers to perform and communicate our
estimations and mathematical arguments.

## Computation vs Quantitative Reasoning

- You have been asked to perform computations
- Your are given a mathematical expression and asked to compute it
- We will practice coming up with the correct expression to compute

# Your attitude toward mathematics

Much of your success will depend on your beliefs about your ability to
learn and improve through effort.

## Do you believe you are a "math person"

- Are you comfortable with mathematics?
- Do you think your abilities can improve with effort and practice?
- When you make important financial decisions, will you try to
    understand the details?

## Grit, Mindset, Effort

- This will not always be easy or pleasurable
- You should be prepared to fail
- Some of your efforts should look like [this](https://t.co/gpISMANVMz)
- I frequently struggle to learn new branches of mathematics

## Bloom's Taxonomy

There are different levels of cognitive skills that we sharpen in higher
education.  Your goal should be to exercise the highest levels of
cognitive skills.

- Remembering
- Understanding
- Applying
- Analyzing
- Evaluating
- Creating

# Activities

## Get to know your neighbor
- Form groups of two or three and discuss any of the following
- What do you like most and least about math?
- What do you hope to get from this class?
- What is your greatest fear about this class?
- Is math important to your career goals?
<!-- now introduce your neighbor to the class -->

## Questions

Think of questions that you want to know the answers to.  Then ask
yourself whether or not mathematics can help answer them.

Here are a few examples:

- Is climate change an urgent problem?
- Does our justice system treat everyone equally and fairly?

## Why are you in college?

- What is important about your degree?
- Is the diploma important?
- Is your choice of major important?
- Are the abilities you will develop important?
