# Motivation

Why is the study of mathematics and its application important?
What will you be able to do if you develop your quantitative skills that you cannot do now?


## Why are you in college?

- What is important about your degree?
- Is the diploma important?
- Is your choice of major important?
- Are the abilities you will develop important?
- One popular reason is to have better employment
- To get better employment one needs better skills
- Applied mathematics skills are valuable for many jobs and problems

## Why is math important to you?

- Do you see yourself using math in the future?
- What kinds of math do you think are most important?

## The power of mathematics

- Mathematics sharpens your common sense.
- Many critical questions about the environment, government, and social
justice are essentially mathematics questions.
- We will demonstrate the power of basic mathematical concepts to gain
insight into these sorts of problems.

## The power of mathematics

Mathematics allows you to see the similar structure in many different
situations.  It is similar to the way a knowledge of music allows you to
see the
[similarity between many popular
songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpB_40hYjXU)

## Limits of Quantitative Reasoning

- Mathematics can only describe the world as it is
- It isn't a good tool for claims about how it should be
- Positive statements are about how the world is
- Normative statements are how we think the world should be

## Learning objectives

- Increase your confidence using mathematics
- Able to use mental and mathematical models
- Quantitative critical thinking

## Knowledge and Skills

- You will gain very little knowledge in this class since we will be
    using mathematics you have already learned
- You will gain many new skills in applying your existing mathematics to
    problems

## Using Computers

We will learn to use computers to perform and communicate our
estimations and mathematical arguments.
