# ENSP 202, Lecture 16, Trigonometry

## Announcements
- Homework assignments on syllabus
- ENSP Applications due this Friday, Mar 27th
- Equinox

<!-- reorient to syllabus -->

## Reading
- Sine qua non, Strogatz Chapter 15
- Sine and cosine goes beyond triangles

## Topics
- Trigonometry
    - Beyond triangles
    - Circles
- Sinusoidal functions
- Trig estimations


## New models
- Triangle model
- Sinusoidal model

## Trigonometry or triangle model
- Trigonometry, as it applies to triangles, is the use of proportions
  with names like sine and tangent.
- The lengths of any two sides of a right triangle of a similar shape
  are proportional.
- The constant of proportionality is the sin, cos, or tangent
- We define "similar shape" by specifying the angles in the triangle

## Triangle model
- What can we model with a triangle?
- The height of a distant object
- An arc length for a small angle

## Sinusoidal model
- We can generalize the triangle and use the unit circle

## Sinusoidal model
- What can we model with a sinusoid?
- Planetary motion
- Synthesizers add sine waves together to make sounds
- Sound is made up of sine waves
- Light is made up of sine waves
- Populations have actions similar to sine waves


<!-- do i have some unit circle art? -->

## Sine and cosine animation
- [Unit Circle, Lucas Barbosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine#/media/File:Circle_cos_sin.gif)

## Different measurements of angle
- Rotations
- Degrees
- Radians

## Rotations
- Divers use full rotations as a unit of angle
- Isn't easy to express small angles

## Degrees
- Divide the circle into 360 parts

## Radians
- Divide the arc length of a wedge by the radius
- Radians have no dimension
- The most beautiful and natural way to describe angles

## Description of the radian
- [Radian, Lucas Barbosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:LucasVB/Gallery#/media/File:Circle_radians.gif)

## Degree and radian conversion factors
- How many degrees in a circle?
- How many radians in a circle?
- Form a conversion factor

## Mathematically expressing a sine wave

$$ \sin\theta $$

$$ \sin \omega t $$

We can think of this as another unit conversion.  In this case instead
of converting degrees to radians, we are converting meters or seconds or
days to radians.  We can think of the greek letter $\omega$ as a
conversion factor.

## Dimensions
- The quantity in the sine or cosine must be dimensionless
- To get a sinusoid with time or space as the argument we use a unit conversion
- $\omega$, $k$ are popular
- $\omega$ has dimensions of radians per unit time
- $k$ has dimensions of radians per distance

## Pi in unexpected places
$$\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots $$

## Announcements

## Due Today
- Homework 7.1, 7.2
- Monday 8.1, 8.2 due

## Review
- Triangles

## How many radians in a thumb?
- Written
- For small angles, we can estimate the arc length as the vertical
  length
- This means in radians for small angles $$\sin\theta \sim \theta$$

## Activity
- Measure angle subtended by your thumb
- Measure height of bacon and eggs
- Measure height of Darwin

## Calculation examples
- Excel
- Calca
- Julia, Jupyter

## Calculator exercises
- Sine and cosine functions
    - Find the sine of 30 degrees
    - Find the cosine of 60 degrees
- Switching between degrees and radians
    - Find the cosine of 1 radian
    - Find the sine of 1/2 a radian
