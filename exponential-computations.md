# Exponential Computations


# Forward

Often an exponential is used to represent a population or an amount of something.

If we want to find the amount or population at a certain time or other independent variable, we substitute our variables and compute the amount.

$$
population = P_0 e^{at}
$$

- $$P_0$$ is the population when $$t=0$$.
- $$a$$ tells us how fast the population is growing.
- $$t$$ is the time.
- We have to be certain that the units for $$a$$ and $$t$$ match.

# Inverse or Logarithm

If we want to find the time at which a population reaches a certain number (dependent variable), we must use the inverse of the exponential.
This inverse is the logarithm.

# Brute force inverse

To find the inverse, you can also guess and adjust your number for the independent variable until you match the dependent variable.

# Graphical Explanation

To go up and to the left, we use the exponent.

To go right and down, we are using the inverse.
