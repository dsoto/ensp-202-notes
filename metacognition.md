# Metacognition

The ability to quickly estimate a quantity is an art and an excellent way to sharpen your quantitative intuition.
An important part of mastering this technique is the ability to diagnose
your own understanding.  This allows you to place your efforts and
questions into the parts of your abilities that need practice.

- How do you know when you have learned something well?
- When you study, how do you know when you have studied enough?
- How do you set aside time for focus and learning?

Much of your success will depend on your beliefs about your ability to learn and improve through effort.
Research has shown that those who believe that they can improve their abilities through practice are able to persevere through tough times and get better at tough tasks like mathematics.

For example, what does it mean to think mathematically?  How is applied
mathematics -- using math to tackle problems --
different from mathematics as you understand it?


## Do you believe you are a "math person"

- Are you comfortable with mathematics?
- Do you think your abilities can improve with effort and practice?
- Do you think that improving your mathematical abilities will help you in the future?
- When you make important financial decisions, will you try to understand the details?

## Grit, Mindset, Effort

- This will not always be easy or pleasurable
- You should be prepared to fail
- Some of your efforts should look like [this](https://t.co/gpISMANVMz)
- I frequently struggle to learn new branches of mathematics


## Bloom's Taxonomy

There are different levels of cognitive skills that we sharpen in higher
education.  Your goal should be to exercise the highest levels of
cognitive skills.
Education scholars created a list of these cognitive processes called Bloom's Taxonomy.

- Remembering "retrieving relevant knowledge from long-term memory"
- Understanding "determining the meaning of instructional messages"
- Applying "carrying out or using a procedure in a given situation"
- Analyzing "breaking material into its constituent pants and detecting how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose"
- Evaluating "making judgements based on criteria and standards"
- Creating "putting elements together to form a novel, coherent, whole or make an original product"

You have probably mastered mathematical rules and computation tools at the level of remembering, understanding, and applying.
You remember the rules and ways to use mathematical formulas as well as the procedures to use computational tools.
You understand the relationships within a mathematical formula.
When it comes time to apply formulas, you are likely comfortable with a "plug-and-chug" approach to getting a numerical answer from a formula.

This class aims to develop your skills analyzing situations to break them down into parts so you can choose which models to apply.
You will learn how to evaluate your own work and that of others to judge whether it correctly follows the rules of mathematics, computation, and evidence.
You will create your own estimations and form your own questions to produce new written estimations and quantitative arguments.

You may initially have difficulty analyzing problems, evaluating the claims of others, and creating your own models, but this will get easier with practice.
It is important to recognize that since computers are able to perform many tasks that fall into the lower levels of this taxonomy, higher-order skills are more valuable and less likely to be automated.

## Learning and Effort

To get do the desired outcome of learning you need to devote time and attention to learning.
There are two main contributions to your learning, the learning in class, and your study outside of class.
The efficiency with which you approach each of these maximizes the amount of learning from each.
At the risk of oversimplifying a complex topic

desired learning = class learning + study learning

We can expand both of these and look at how efficiently we use our time

desired learning = class time x class focus + study time x study focus

Using algebra to isolate study time, which most students want to minimize,

study time = (desired learning - class time * class focus) / study focus

Crudely, for a desired learning outcome, you can decrease the time you must spend studying by increasing your focus during class and during study.

## Scheduling your time

What works better for you when you work on assignments?

- Finishing in a single four-hour block?
- Breaking up an assignment over four separate one-hour blocks?
- Do you find yourself working when you are not at your cognitive peak?


# Motivation

Why is the study of mathematics and its application important?
What will you be able to do if you develop your quantitative skills that you cannot do now?


## Why are you in college?

- What is important about your degree?
- Is the diploma important?
- Is your choice of major important?
- Are the abilities you will develop important?
- One popular reason is to have better employment
- To get better employment one needs better skills
- Applied mathematics skills are valuable for many jobs and problems

## Why is math important to you?

- Do you see yourself using math in the future?
- What kinds of math do you think are most important?

## The power of mathematics

- Mathematics sharpens your common sense.
- Many critical questions about the environment, government, and social
justice are essentially mathematics questions.
- We will demonstrate the power of basic mathematical concepts to gain
insight into these sorts of problems.

## The power of mathematics

Mathematics allows you to see the similar structure in many different
situations.  It is similar to the way a knowledge of music allows you to
see the
[similarity between many popular
songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpB_40hYjXU)

## Knowledge and Skills

- You will gain very little knowledge in this class since we will be using mathematics you have already learned
- You will gain many new skills in applying your existing mathematics to problems
