# Metacognition

An important part of mastering mathematics is the ability to diagnose
your own understanding.  This allows you to place your efforts and
questions into the parts of your abilities that need practice.

- How do you know when you have learned something well?
- When you study, how do you know when you have studied enough?
- How do you set aside time for focus and learning?

## Scheduling your time

What works better for you when you work on assignments?

- Finishing in a single four-hour block?
- Breaking up an assignment over four separate one-hour blocks?
- Do you find yourself working when you are not at your cognitive peak?


## Your attitude toward mathematics

Much of your success will depend on your beliefs about your ability to
learn and improve through effort.

## Do you believe you are a "math person"

- Are you comfortable with mathematics?
- Do you think your abilities can improve with effort and practice?
- When you make important financial decisions, will you try to
    understand the details?

## Grit, Mindset, Effort

- This will not always be easy or pleasurable
- You should be prepared to fail
- Some of your efforts should look like [this](https://t.co/gpISMANVMz)
- I frequently struggle to learn new branches of mathematics


## Bloom's Taxonomy

There are different levels of cognitive skills that we sharpen in higher
education.  Your goal should be to exercise the highest levels of
cognitive skills.

You may initially have difficulty analyzing problems, evaluating the
claims of others, and creating your own models, but this will get easier
with practice.

- Remembering
- Understanding
- Applying
- Analyzing
- Evaluating
- Creating

It is important to recognize that computers are able to perform many
tasks that fall into the lower levels of this taxonomy.

# Critical Thinking

There are several important concepts from critical thinking that we will
use in this class.

## The Principle of Charity

- Consider an argument to be rational and worthy of exploration
- If we see an quantitative analysis we disagree with, it is only through
    understanding it that we can seek to find its flaws

## Rival Causes

- The first explanation is not always the correct one
- Rival causes are plausible reasons for observing the same outcome
- It is often useful to examine multiple rival causes to see which one
    is the best explanation
