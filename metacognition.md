# Metacognition

An important part of mastering mathematics is the ability to diagnose
your own understanding.  This allows you to place your efforts and
questions into the parts of your abilities that need practice.

- How do you know when you have learned something well?
- When you study, how do you know when you have studied enough?
- How do you set aside time for focus and learning?

## Scheduling your time

What works better for you when you work on assignments?

- Finishing in a single four-hour block?
- Breaking up an assignment over four separate one-hour blocks?
- Do you find yourself working when you are not at your cognitive peak?


## Your attitude toward mathematics

Much of your success will depend on your beliefs about your ability to
learn and improve through effort.

## Do you believe you are a "math person"

- Are you comfortable with mathematics?
- Do you think your abilities can improve with effort and practice?
- When you make important financial decisions, will you try to
    understand the details?

## Grit, Mindset, Effort

- This will not always be easy or pleasurable
- You should be prepared to fail
- Some of your efforts should look like [this](https://t.co/gpISMANVMz)
- I frequently struggle to learn new branches of mathematics


## Bloom's Taxonomy

There are different levels of cognitive skills that we sharpen in higher
education.  Your goal should be to exercise the highest levels of
cognitive skills.

You may initially have difficulty analyzing problems, evaluating the
claims of others, and creating your own models, but this will get easier
with practice.

- Remembering
- Understanding
- Applying
- Analyzing
- Evaluating
- Creating

It is important to recognize that computers are able to perform many
tasks that fall into the lower levels of this taxonomy.

## Learning and Effort

To get do the desired outcome of learning you need to devote time and attention to learning.
There are two main contributions to your learning, the learning in class, and your study outside of class.
The efficiency with which you approach each of these maximizes the amount of learning from each.
At the risk of oversimplifying a complex topic

desired learning = class learning + study learning

We can expand both of these and look at how efficiently we use our time

desired learning = class time x class focus + study time x study focus

Using algebra to isolate study time, which most students want to minimize,

study time = (desired learning - class time * class focus) / study focus

Crudely, for a desired learning outcome, you can decrease the time you must spend studying by increasing your focus during class and during study.
