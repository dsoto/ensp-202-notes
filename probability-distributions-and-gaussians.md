# Probability Distributions and Gaussians

## Probability Distribution

A probability distribution is a model that explains the relative probability of different events happening.

The x-axis is the value of a measurement and the y-axis is the relative frequency.

The area under the curve of a (normalized) probability distribution is exactly one.

The probability of a measurement occurring between two intervals is the area under the curve between those two intervals.

These probability distributions are models just like a rectangle or a circle.
This probability distribution is usually a mathematical function.

For example, the gaussian distribution is given by

$$f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/\sigma^2}$$

Notice our new friend, the number e, showing up.

## Histogram

The probability distribution is an ideal mathematical model.
The real world doesn't fit it exactly, but the model provides lots of practical power.

## Relative probability

If you can calculate or estimate the area under the curve of a probability distribution, you can predict the probability of an event occurring.
