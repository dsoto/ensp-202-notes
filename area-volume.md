We rarely measure areas directly.  For example, there is no tape measure
that has an area.

- What is the area of skin on the human body?
- Without looking, how much volume in a can of soda?
- How much water in your water bottle?
- What is the volume of the aluminum?
- How much does an empty can weigh?

## Learning Objectives
- Estimate areas
- Convert between units of areas
- Use the body as a measurement tool

## Rectangle
![Rectangle](../figures/area-rectangle.pdf)

## Circle
![Circle](../figures/area-circle.pdf)

## Ellipse
![Ellipse](../figures/area-ellipse.pdf)

## Any shape
![General shape](../figures/area-general.pdf)

## Areas
- Notice that these all involve the length and the width and a factor

| shape     |  area             |
|-----------|-------------------|
| rectangle | $l \cdot w$       |
| circle    | $0.79\ l \cdot w$ |
| ellipse   | $0.79\ l \cdot w$ |

## Area
- Has dimension of length squared

## Your body as a unit of length
- What on your body forms a convenient unit of measure?

<!-- fingers are good for centimeters and inches -->
<!-- elbow to wrist about a foot -->
<!-- my navel is about 1 meter high -->
<!-- my stride is about 1.5 meters -->


## Basic Volumes
- Cube
- Cylinder
- Pyramid
- Sphere

## What is in common?
- A length times a length times a length
- Has dimensions of length cubed
- Volume only differs from a rectangular prism by a factor

## Cylinder

## Sphere

## Activity
- Estimate the volume of our classroom

## Converting volumes
- How many cubic inches in a cubic foot?

## Converting volumes
- Convert cubic meters to liters

## Square roots
- If I have a certain area, how do I find the square that contains that
  area?

## Question
- I have a coupon for 1000 square feet of carpet.
- What is the largest square room I can cover?

## Cube roots
- If I have a volume, how do I find the cube that contains that volume?

## Exercise
- Estimate the area of our classroom
- Using units of your stride squared
- Using the floor tiles
- Convert between square strides and square feet

## Converting volumes
$$ 1 m^3 \cdot \frac{100cm}{m}  \cdot \frac{100cm}{m}  \cdot \frac{100cm}{m} = 10^6 cm^3$$
$$ 1 m^3 \cdot \left( \frac{100cm}{m} \right)^3 = 1m^3 \cdot \frac{10^6 cm^3}{m^3} = 10^6 cm^3 $$

## Area as a way of understanding formulas

## Pythagorean theorem

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

- We usually interpret as a relation between the sides of a right
  triangle
- We can also interpret as a statement about the areas

## Pythagorean theorem

## Quadratic theorem as an area
- Blends algebra and areas

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
