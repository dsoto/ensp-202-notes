Areas and Volumes

# Common shape areas
We rarely measure areas directly.  For example, there is no tape measure
that has an area.

## Circle

## Ellipse

## Any shape

## Areas
- Notice that these all involve the length and the width and a factor

| shape     |  area             |
|-----------|-------------------|
| rectangle | $$l \cdot w$$       |
| circle    | $$0.79\ l \cdot w$$ |
| ellipse   | $$0.79\ l \cdot w$$ |

## Area
- Has dimension of length squared



# Common Shape Volumes

## Basic Volumes
- Cube
- Cylinder
- Pyramid
- Sphere

## What is in common?
- A length times a length times a length
- Has dimensions of length cubed
- Volume only differs from a rectangular prism by a factor

# Unit Conversion

## Converting areas

A common source of area is forgetting to apply a linear conversion twice
to get an area conversion.

$$ 1 m^2 = 1 \cdot meter \cdot meter $$

$$ 1 \cdot meter \cdot meter \cdot \frac{100cm}{meter}  \cdot \frac{100cm}{meter} = 10^4 cm^2$$

## Converting volumes
$$ 1 m^3 \cdot \frac{100cm}{m}  \cdot \frac{100cm}{m}  \cdot \frac{100cm}{m} = 10^6 cm^3$$
$$ 1 m^3 \cdot \left( \frac{100cm}{m} \right)^3 = 1m^3 \cdot \frac{10^6 cm^3}{m^3} = 10^6 cm^3 $$

## Converting volumes
- How many cubic inches in a cubic foot?

## Converting volumes
- Convert cubic meters to liters

# Roots

Roots answer the question, what is the size of square or cube that I can
fit a given quantity in?

## Square roots
- If I have a certain area, how do I find the square that contains that
  area?

## Cube roots
- If I have a volume, how do I find the cube that contains that volume?

# Examples


## GPA

The calculation of a grade point average can be thought of as an area
problem.

![](./figures/gpa-area.png)

The average is the height of a rectangle that is 10 units long, or 2.79.

## River flow

We can estimate the flow of a creek if we know the rate of rainfall and
the land area that drains into the creek.

# Area as a way of understanding formulas


## Pythagorean theorem

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

- We usually interpret as a relation between the sides of a right
  triangle
- We can also interpret as a statement about the areas

## Quadratic theorem as an area
- Blends algebra and areas

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
