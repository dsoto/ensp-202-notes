This course deals with the application of mathematics to imprecise,
real-world applications.  In order to move from prescribed textbook
problems to more open-ended ones, we need to develop some further
skills.

For example, what does it mean to think mathematically?  How is applied
mathematics -- using math to tackle problems --
different from mathematics as you understand it?
