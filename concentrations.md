What happens if we spill an amount of a toxic chemical into a lake?  How
much of the chemical do we have to spill before it is dangerous?

How much toxin from cyanobacteria must be released before the shellfish
are dangerous to eat?

To make these estimations, we can use concentrations as a tool.

When you encounter the terms parts per million or parts per billion,
these work exactly like percentages (parts per hundred).




## Concentration

$$ \frac{\textrm{mass or volume of material of interest}}
        {\textrm{total mass or volume}} $$

## Dilution Demonstration

## Concentration
- For our 100 to 1 dilutions, the concentration is

$$ 10^{-2\cdot\textrm{dilutions}} $$

## Concentration Units
- Percentages
- Parts per million (ppm)
- Parts per billion (ppm)
- Parts per trillion (ppt)

## Concentration Visualization
- How many cubic centimeters in a cubic meter?
- Each cubic centimeter is one millionth of a cubic meter

## Concentrations
- What are examples of concentrations you think are important?

## Example: Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)

$$ BAC = \frac{\textrm{volume of alcohol}}
              {\textrm{volume of blood}} $$

<!-- perform example calculation -->
<!-- 3 liters of blood in a human -->
<!-- 3 liters * 0.0008 = 0.0024 liters = 2.4 ml  -->

## Example: Carbon Dioxide

$$  \frac{\textrm{volume carbon dioxide}}
         {\textrm{volume of atmosphere}} $$

<!-- use cubic meter to visualize 400 ppm -->
<!-- what is the size of a 400 ml cube? -->


## Review
- What is a concentration
- PPM
- percentage
- visualizations?
- Homeopathic C scale dilutions
- Ink dilution activity
- Molarity
- pH
- check out written notes

## Molarity of mercury?

## Molarity of soda?

## Dimensions and Units

Concentrations are dimensionless but have specific physical meanings
that you must keep track of


<!-- list some concentrations in environmental literature -->
<!-- - air concentrations of NOx SOx CO2 CH4 -->
<!-- - salinity haloclines -->

## pH scale
- Acids have low pH
- Bases have high pH
- This scale is logarithmic in base 10
- One pH is a factor of 10 of the concentration of hydrogen ions

## Concentration by weight
- Sugar in a can of soda
- Written

<!-- - what is the concentration by weight of sugar in soda 39gr/355ml -->


<!-- - how are concentrations changing over time? -->
<!-- - what if we are dripping pollution into a lake? -->
<!-- - can we express this as a concentration as a function of time? -->

## Topics
- Concentrations
- Stocks and flows


## Reading
- Adding rates
- Limiting examples
<!-- does your answer hold when you use extreme examples for the rates? -->
- Simplifying assumptions
<!-- this is much of what this class is about -->

## Adding rates
- Written notes

## Parts by volume and parts by mass
- We model the atmosphere as an ideal gas
- This means that the volume fraction is the same as the fraction of the
  number of molecules
- To convert from volume to mass, we use the molar mass

## Molar mass
- One mole equals 6.02 $\cdot$ 10^23^ atoms or molecules
- Carbon weighs 12 grams for every mole of carbon
- Oxygen weighs 16 grams for every mole of oxygen
- How much does one mole of carbon dioxide weigh?
- Our atmosphere weighs 29 grams for every mole
