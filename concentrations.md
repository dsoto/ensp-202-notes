# Overview

## Motivation

What happens if we spill an amount of a toxic chemical into a lake?  How
much of the chemical do we have to spill before it is dangerous?

How much toxin from cyanobacteria must be released before the shellfish
are dangerous to eat?

To make these estimations, we can use concentrations as a tool.

When you encounter the terms parts per million or parts per billion,
these work exactly like percentages (parts per hundred).

Many of you have a command of percentages.  These concentrations are
simply generalizations of the concept of percentages.  Once you realize
that a percentage is equivalent to parts per hundred, you will be able
to understand and use parts per million and billion confidently.


## Examples of concentrations

- Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere
- Blood Alcohol content
- What are examples of concentrations you think are important?

## Concentration Units
- Percentages
- Parts per million (ppm)
- Parts per billion (ppm)
- Parts per trillion (ppt)

Do these have dimensions?  Do they have units?

# Details

## Concentration

We usually define a concentration as the ratio of a quantity of
interest (pollutant) to the total volume of the material containing the
pollutant.

$$ \frac{\textrm{mass or volume of material of interest}}
        {\textrm{total mass or volume}} $$



## Concentration Visualization
- How many cubic centimeters in a cubic meter?
- Each cubic centimeter is one millionth of a cubic meter


## Example: Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)

$$ BAC = \frac{\textrm{volume of alcohol}}
              {\textrm{volume of blood}} $$

<!-- perform example calculation -->
<!-- 3 liters of blood in a human -->
<!-- 3 liters * 0.0008 = 0.0024 liters = 2.4 ml  -->

How much pure ethyl alcohol is in the average blood stream at the legal
limit?

## Example: Carbon Dioxide

$$  \frac{\textrm{volume carbon dioxide}}
         {\textrm{volume of atmosphere}} $$

We are currently at about 400 ppm.

## Converting between concentrations

To convert between different types of fractions, you can use your
existing intuition from percentages.  The main difference is that
instead of parts per hundred, you will likely be using parts per million
or billion.

## Percentage Conversion

If a concentration is 50 percent, what is the fraction (a number between
1 and 0).

$$ 50\% = \frac{50\ parts}{100\ parts} = 0.5 $$

## Parts Per Million Conversion

For the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, it is currently 400
parts per million.

$$ 400\ ppm = \frac{400 parts\ CO2}{10^6 parts air} = 0.0004 $$

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply the top and bottom
by the number (100) that gives us 100 parts on the bottom.

$$ 400\ ppm = 0.0004 = 0.0004 \frac{parts CO2}{1 part air}
  \cdot \frac{10^2}{10^2} =
   \frac{4 \cdot 10^{-2}}{10^2 parts}$$

We can do the same but this time the number is $10^{-4}$ to give us a
percentage.

$$ 400\ ppm = \frac{400 parts CO2}{10^6 parts air}
  \cdot \frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-4}} =
   \frac{4 \cdot 10^{-2}}{10^2 parts}$$


## Dimensions and Units

Concentrations are dimensionless but have specific physical meanings
that you must keep track of.


<!-- list some concentrations in environmental literature -->
<!-- - air concentrations of NOx SOx CO2 CH4 -->
<!-- - salinity haloclines -->

## pH scale
- Acids have low pH
- Bases have high pH
- This scale is logarithmic in base 10
- One pH is a factor of 10 of the concentration of hydrogen ions

## Concentration by weight
- Sugar in a can of soda
- Written

<!-- - what is the concentration by weight of sugar in soda 39gr/355ml -->


<!-- - how are concentrations changing over time? -->
<!-- - what if we are dripping pollution into a lake? -->
<!-- - can we express this as a concentration as a function of time? -->

# Changing Concentrations

How does the concentration change if we add more of a pollutant over
time?  We can add a linear model to our analysis.

## Atmospheric CO2

## Carbon Dioxide
- [Keeling Curve Website](http://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/)
- [Scripps Oxygen Measurements](http://scrippso2.ucsd.edu/)

<!-- use cubic meter to visualize 400 ppm -->
<!-- what is the size of a 400 ml cube? -->


## Parts by volume and parts by mass
- We model the atmosphere as an ideal gas
- This means that the volume fraction is the same as the fraction of the
  number of molecules
- To convert from volume to mass, we use the molar mass

## Molar mass
- One mole equals 6.02 $\cdot$ 10^23^ atoms or molecules
- Carbon weighs 12 grams for every mole of carbon
- Oxygen weighs 16 grams for every mole of oxygen
- How much does one mole of carbon dioxide weigh?
- Our atmosphere weighs 29 grams for every mole

# Activities

## ETC Carbon Dioxide Concentration

During class, the ETC CO2 concentration increases.  Is it increasing at
the rate you would expect?

## Dilution Demonstration
What is the concentration of a chemical by volume after a number of 100
to 1 dilutions?  We demonstrate this with ink and water in a beaker

For our 100 to 1 dilutions, the concentration is

$$ 10^{-2\cdot\textrm{dilutions}} $$

## Molarity of mercury?

## Molarity of soda?
