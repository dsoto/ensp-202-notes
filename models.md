# Models

We will learn how to create simple models that enable us to gain insight
into the problem we are investigating.
You also usually can not estimate your quantity directly, but must instead break down your estimate into other smaller estimation problems that can be tackled individually.
We will start with simple estimations and then move on to estimations that require more planning.

- A simplified representation of a problem we'd like to solve
- A model is an approximation that allows us to think about the world
- Models:
    - rectangle
    - linear increase or decrease
    - exponential increase or decrease
    - a roll of a die or several dice
    - a bathtub with a faucet and a drain
- The situation you are modeling won't always look exactly like the
    model
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- Can you think of an example of a model?
- Models often contain assumptions about the problem that others may not
    share

## Estimations and models
- Understand the problem
- Take a guess
- Identify the most important quantities
- Estimate the value of these quantities
- Set up the computation as clearly as possible
- Execute the computation
- Decide if the result is plausible
- See if it matches your original guess


## Models
- We have been using models
- We have modeled each person as eating exactly the same number of
slices
- Most models assume that a real world problem will behave like a
mathematical function
- Models are normative and make assumptions about the world
- Modeling is the important mathematical literacy we are developing

## Future topics

- Quantities, dimensions, and units
- Scientific notation for representing large numbers
- Using computers to ensure reliable computation

# More complex models

In the Art of Insight, Sanjoy Mahajan presents ways of determining what
estimations you need to make in your model.  A useful tool is a tree
model.

This diagram is a tree model to help us determine the volume of a dollar
bill.

Note how we break up our goal estimation into smaller problems and then
work to determine if the smaller problems require further decomposition.
